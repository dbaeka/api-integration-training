# API Integration Training

This application is a templated application for integrating during the course development. The main branch contains code that should get you started. Any additional edits or practice should happen on a feature branch.

Pull Requests are welcome for branch review but will in no way be merged into the main branch unless there is a legit issue being addressed.
